# Recommendation-System
This system makes movie recommendations based on an algorithm similar to KNN. 

## Setting up the environment to locally host the app
- Ensure you have pip installed all the required libraries
- Make sure to adjust the absolute paths of the .csv files after git cloning the repository
- Open up your terminal/command prompt and cd to the 'model' folder and run the command "streamlit run streamlit_app.py"
- Have fun!
